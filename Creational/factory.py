''' 
Factory: delegate the instantiation of objects to subclasses
animal = Dog()
Hard to extend: What if later you want to use Cat instead? You have to change every place that uses Dog().
âœ… Factory Method Solves This By:
Defining a common interface (Animal)

Abstracting the instantiation logic into a method (create_animal)

Delegating the choice of class to subclasses (DogFactory, CatFactory)

Now your client code depends only on the interface, not on the concrete implementation.

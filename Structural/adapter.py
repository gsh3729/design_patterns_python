'''
You have an existing class, but its interface (method names, behaviors) does not match what your client code expects.

Solution: Instead of modifying the existing class (which might be impossible, especially if it's external or legacy code), create a new Adapter class.

ğŸŸ¡ Adapter Class:

Internally holds (wraps) an instance of the old class.

Externally offers the new, correct interface.

Translates calls from the new interface to the old one.

ğŸ‘‰ Main logic: "Don't change the old class. Wrap it and make it behave correctly."

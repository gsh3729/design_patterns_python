Pattern | Quick Idea
Adapter | Makes two incompatible interfaces work together. (like a translator)
Bridge | Separates an abstraction from its implementation so they can vary independently.
Composite | Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. (tree structures)
Decorator | Adds behavior to objects dynamically without changing their code.
Facade | Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code (subsystems).
Flyweight | Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
Proxy | Controls access to another object, adding additional behavior (like lazy loading or security).
